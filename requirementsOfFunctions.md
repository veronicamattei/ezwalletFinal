# EZWallet Full API Specifications

This document lists all the expected behaviors for the APIs that compose the EZWallet application.
The examples regarding request parameters and request body content must be followed: all attributes must be named in the same ways as the examples. The examples regarding response `data` content define the necessary attributes that must be present in the objects returned by the various APIs, other additional attributes can be present but are not required.
In cases where the APIs return an error the correct structure to follow is:

```javascript
res.status(errorCode).json({ error: "Error message" });
```

The actual value of the `error`, `message`, and `refreshedTokenMessage` attributes, where required, does not matter as long as the attributes are included in the return object (any string is accepted).
Route parameters (where needed) cannot be empty, as not having them would define a new route, leading to a 404 error in Postman.

### utils.js

#### `handleDateFilterParams`

- Returns an object with a `date` attribute used for filtering mongoDB's `aggregate` queries

  - If the query parameters include `from` then it must include a `$gte` attribute that specifies the starting date as a `Date` object in the format **YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm:ss**
    - Example: `/api/users/Mario/transactions?from=2023-04-30` => `{date: {$gte: 2023-04-30T00:00:00.000Z}}`

#### `handleAmountFilterParams`

- Returns an object with an `amount` attribute used for filtering mongoDB's `aggregate` queries
- The value of `amount` is an object that depends on the query parameters:
  - If the query parameters include `min` then it must include a `$gte` attribute that is an integer equal to `min`
    - Example: `/api/users/Mario/transactions?min=10` => `{amount: {$gte: 10} }
  - If the query parameters include `min` then it must include a `$lte` attribute that is an integer equal to `max`
    - Example: `/api/users/Mario/transactions?min=50` => `{amount: {$lte: 50} }
  - If both `min` and `max` are present then both `$gte` and `$lte` must be included
- Throws an error if the value of any of the two query parameters is not a numerical value
